Comments describing AST_PrinterTest

Test that prints the parse tree (AST) for a given query.
Useful to see the parse tree when making changes to derby's sql grammar.

For each query, a plan tree is printed for each of the three phases;
parse, bind, optimize.


TO BUILD and RUN This test depends on the splice derby jars you have built
and installed into your local repo. The splice server must be built against
these jars and it must be running.  (See the pom.xml for dependency details)

mvn clean install
 
NOTE, currently you must have schema and tables populated for the given query you're running.
