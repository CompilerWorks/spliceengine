Intermediate (manual build) standalone package.

Steps to prepare
1.  Make sure database is stopped (cd bin; ./stopdb) and clean (cd bin; ./cleandb.sh) - no error checking done yet
2.  Copy ALL most recent jar files (excluding source) to standalone/lib directory (script TODO)
3.  Tar up standalone directory
4.  Deploy wherever

Steps to deploy/run
1.  Untar wherever
2.  Make sure there are db, log, log/target, and lib directories under standalone.
2.  Start database (cd bin; ./startdb.sh)
3.  After database has started, you can connect (cd bin; ./sqlshell.sh)

TODO:
1.  True mvn package (including collection of jars)
2.  splice-site.xml - needed?
3.  Anything missing from the package?
4.  Add error checking and other cleanups
5.  Does Yarn state have to go into log/target?
