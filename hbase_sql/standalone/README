Welcome to the v2.0 Splice Machine standalone version.

Note that it currently ONLY supports CentOS or MacOS X at this time.

See the following to set up your CentOS instance:
http://doc.splicemachine.com/InstallationGuide/InstallStandalone/Intro.InstallStandalone.html

Additionally on CentOS, you will need to make ulimit changes (substituting your login username for
"splice" in the file referred to below):

$  cat /etc/security/limits.d/91-splice.conf

splice   soft   nproc     16384
splice   hard   nproc     16384
splice   soft   nofile    16384
splice   hard   nofile    16384

Now download the standalone package from S3:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/splice-temp-transfer/k2beta-standalone/standalone.tar.gz

Steps to deploy/run:
1.  Untar wherever you like (tar xzf standalone.tar.gz)
2.  cd standalone
3.  Start database (cd bin; ./startdb.sh)
4.  After database has started (i.e. startdb.sh has completed), you can connect (cd bin; ./sqlshell.sh)
5.  After another minute, the Spark UI will be available at http://<serveraddress-or-localhost>:4040
6.  To stop the database use the stop command (cd bin; ./stopdb.sh)
7.  To wipe the database, use the clean command (cd bin; ./cleandb.sh).  Make sure you stop first.
