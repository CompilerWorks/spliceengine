Intermediate (manual build) standalone package.

Steps to prepare
1.  Make sure you've done a recent complete build so that all jars are available
2.  Stop (stopdb.sh) and clean (cleandb.sh) first before packaging
3.  Run copyjars.sh to bring in the lib jars
4.  Remove libold and copyjars.sh
5.  Tar up standalone directory
6.  Deploy wherever

Steps to deploy/run
1.  Untar wherever
2.  Make sure there are db, log, log/target, and lib directories under standalone.
2.  Start database (cd bin; ./startdb.sh)
3.  After database has started, you can connect (cd bin; ./sqlshell.sh)

TODO:
1.  True mvn package (including collection of jars)
2.  splice-site.xml - needed?
3.  Anything missing from the package?  So far no
4.  Does Yarn state have to go into log/target? (low priority)
