Intermediate (manual build) standalone packaging instructions.

Steps to prepare
1.  Make sure you've done a recent complete build so that all jars are available
2.  Stop (stopdb.sh) and clean (cleandb.sh) first before packaging
3.  Run copyjars.sh to bring in the lib jars
4.  Remove libold and copyjars.sh and README-pkg files
5.  Make sure there are (empty) db, log, and log/target directories under standalone
5.  Tar up standalone directory - it is good to go

Steps to deploy/run (more detailed instructions under README file
1.  Untar wherever
2.  Start database (cd bin; ./startdb.sh)
3.  After database has started, you can connect (cd bin; ./sqlshell.sh)

TODO:
1.  True mvn package (including collection of jars)
2.  splice-site.xml - needed?
3.  Anything missing from the package?  So far no
4.  Does Yarn state have to go into log/target? (low priority)
