Running the ITs against the In-memory architecture
===
The configuration for running the MemDatabase in the context of running ITs
resides in engine_it. Essentially, from the top level(one directory up from this)
issue the command

mvn install -Pmem

to build,test, and install the in-memory architecture in a single fell swoop
