				 * Interpolating Strings requires a bit of finagling with the mathematics.
				 *
				 * First, it's important to recognize that a String is a sequence of characters, each
				 * of which can take on values in UTF-8. Thus, each character in a string is only allowed
				 * a finite number of possible elements (approximately 1 million, represented as UTF_LENGTH).
				 *
				 * So, if we assign a number to each possible character in UTF-8, we can transform a string
				 * into a decimal number in base UTF_LENGTH, by the formula
				 *
				 * sum (c[i]*L^(-i))
				 *
				 * where i is the position of the character in the string, and c[i] is the UTF-8 codepoint
				 * of the character in the string (L = UTF_LENGTH).
				 *
				 * However, considering how large UTF_LENGTH is, these numbers would all be really small. To make
				 * that calculation easier, we scale the number up by the expected width of the string. This makes the
				 * numbers larger and thus less prone to round off errors in the high ends of the decimals, resulting in
				 *
				 * sum (c[i]*L^(width-i))
				 *
				 * Unfortunately, when width>2, UTF_LENGTH^width overflows a double, and UTF_LENGTH^(-width) will underflow.
				 * Thus, in order to retain precision, we have to use BigDecimals with a high precision.
