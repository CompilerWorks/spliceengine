==========================================================
1. A brief introduction to the Splice Machine SQL Database
==========================================================

The Splice Machine Database is just that - a SQL database.  This means that from a SQL perspective, 
relational tables can be created, data inserted/modified/deleted, and queried, all using standard SQL.  
Additionally, the Splice Machine Database enforces ACID properties and supports transaction processing,
indexing, and a number of other capabilities you come to expect from a full relational database.

What makes the Splice Machine Database unique is that the back end storage is Hadoop and HBase.  Further,
the Database engine has been tuned to leverage parallel processing across the multiple HBase Regions and
Region Servers in your Hadoop deployment.  This enables a scalable database solution that can easily handle 
billions of rows of data.

=========================================================
2. How to download and launch the Splice Machine Database
=========================================================

The following describes how you can download a self-contained package to run the Splice Machine Database.

Note: these installation instructions are for setting up and running a single (unclustered) instance of the 
database.  For instructions to set up on a cluster, contact Splice Machine at http://support.splicemachine.com.

Prerequisites:
  On Linux or Mac systems:
   - JDK 1.6 or greater needs to be on your system
   - 4GB or more of available memory
   - 300+ MB available disk space for download package and sample data
  On Windows:
   - Cygwin needs to be installed (see www.cygwin.com).  All commands will be issued within a Cygwin shell window.
   - 4GB or more of available memory
   - 300+ MB available disk space for download package and sample data

To download the Cloudera package, navigate to the following (approx. 80 MB):
   http://d10sdxe2fhfs9c.cloudfront.net/splice_machine-0.5rc2-cloudera-cdh4.3.0_simple.tar.gz

Once you have downloaded the package, put the gz file in a working directory, then unzip:
$ tar -xzf splice_machine-0.5rc2-cloudera-cdh4.3.0_simple.tar.gz

Navigate to the bin directory:
$ cd splicemachine

Start up the database processes:
$ ./bin/start-splice.sh

While the database is running, it will write to the splice.log file found in the splicemachine directory.
When you see "Ready to accept connections" in that log, the database is ready for use.

================================================================
3. Connecting to the database and performing simple SQL commands
================================================================

Once the database is running, you can bring up the interactive query interface:

a.  cd to the splicemachine directory that was installed
b.  launch the query interface using the shell command ./bin/sqlshell.sh

c. Once you see the "splice>" prompt, you first need to connect to a database:
splice> connect 'jdbc:splice://localhost:1527/splicedb';

Now you can issue SQL commands at the splice> prompt.  Note that all commands end
with a semicolon (;).
d.  create a table:
splice> create table test (i int);

e.  add data to the table:
splice> insert into test values 1,2,3,4,5;

f.  query data in that table:
splice> select * from test;

g.  drop the table:
splice> drop table test;

h.  exit the query interface:
splice> quit;

======================================================================
4. (Optional) How to import the provided sample data into the Database
======================================================================

At this point you have enough information to start running queries against your own data.  Refer to
the SQL Reference (see documentation link below) for command and syntax details and examples.

To help you get started we have also made available sample data to load and run queries against, as
well as a load script to import this data.  Four tables will be created, each with one million records:

TRANSACTION_HEADER  - standard "headers" from a transaction system
TRANSACTION_DETAIL - standard "detail" records from a transaction system
PRODUCT_DIVISION_SUMMARY - aggregated customer sales data by date
TARGETS - a list of "target" customers

Compressed, this is about 200MB of data.  The link to access this data is at:
http://d10sdxe2fhfs9c.cloudfront.net/demodata.tar.gz

To import the data:
a. navigate to the spicemachine directory created when downloading the software. Copy the downloaded .gz
file to this location, then unzip:
$ tar -xvf demodata.tar.gz
(you will see that this creates a demodata directory, with data and sql directories underneath.)

b. Start up the database if it isn't started already, and launch the query interface (using ./bin/sqlshell.sh)

c. From the splice> prompt, "run" the file:
splice> run '<full path to loadall.sql> file';  -- loadall.sql is found underneath database/sql
Example:
splice> run '/Users/bsmith/splice/demodata/database/sql/loadall.sql';

This will take a few minutes. The loadall.sql file will create the schema, load the data,
and create indexes for the tables.

===================================================================
5. (Optional) How to run sample queries on the provided sample data
===================================================================
 
Here are a few queries to try from the query interface (splice>).  First, start up the
interface if it isn't already running (using ./bin/sqlshell.sh).

Then try these queries out (splice> omitted so you can copy and paste right at the splice> prompt):

1. Grab the customer ids of a subset of transaction_detail records based on category_id and transaction_dt:
select customer_master_id
from transaction_detail d
where TRANSACTION_DT >= DATE('2010-01-01') and TRANSACTION_DT <= DATE('2013-12-31')
AND ORIGINAL_SKU_CATEGORY_ID >= 44427 and original_sku_category_id <= 44431;

2. Header and targets table queried with a join:
select t.*
from targets e, transaction_header t
where e.customer_master_id=t.customer_master_id
and t.customer_master_id > 14000 and t.customer_master_id < 15000;


===============================================================
6. How to access the online or downloadable (PDF) documentation
===============================================================

Splice Documentation can be found at http://doc.splicemachine.com.  It is available 
online, and can be downloaded as a PDF.

================================
7. How to shut down the database
================================

To shut down the database:

a. First make sure you have "quit;" from any splice> prompts:
splice> quit;

b. cd to the splicemachine directory that was installed

c. run the following:
$ ./bin/stop-splice.sh

================================
7. How to clean the database
================================

To clean the database (essentially wiping out any existing tables, indexes, etc):

a. First make sure you have "quit;" from any splice> prompts:
splice> quit;

b. cd to the splicemachine directory that was installed

c. run the following:
$ ./bin/stop-splice.sh
$ ./bin/clean.sh
$ ./bin/start-splice.sh


=========================
9. Useful tips and tricks
=========================

- At the splice> prompt, remember to always end any SQL statement with a semicolon (;):
splice> select * from a;

- SQL statements can go across multiple lines at the splice> prompt.  Just be sure to end 
the last line with a semicolon.  Note that incomplete statements will cause the query
interface to put a ">" at the beginning of the next line for you to continue to type on:
splice> select * from a
> where i > 1;

- You can run collections of sql statements in a file.  To do so use "run":
splice> run 'path/to/file.sql';

- Some useful commands from the splice> prompt include:
splice> show tables; -- shows a list of all tables and their schemas in the database
splice> describe <table>; -- shows columns and attributes of the specified table

- To limit the number of rows returned, use { limit <numrows> };
splice> select * from a { limit 10 };

- The following command is useful to put into scripts to print a current timestamp
(in order to time query performance, for example):
splice> values current_timestamp;

- For HBase veterans (or people new to HBase who are curious to see a little of what is going on under
the covers), the default HBase URL can be used to access HBase Master:
http://localhost:60010 
(on Windows: http://127.0.0.1:60010)

- As with any database, you can very easily write slow queries.  Here are some tips to help avoid this:
  - Use a WHERE clause to restrict how much data is scanned
  - If there is an index on the criteria used in the WHERE clause (or if the where clause is using a primary key), 
this helps speed up the query.  Composite indexes work well here.
  - Indexing doesn't yet help for MAX(), MIN(), and IN() criteria.  If you can change these to =, >, BETWEEN,
the index will help 

- The query optimizer logic is in its earliest stages.  Therefore it may be required to provide "hints" to help
make queries run faster by giving it a correct strategy.

- Hints can provide the following information:
  - which index to use ("index=<index name>").  You can use index=NULL if you want NO index to be used.
  - which table join order to use (joinOrder = { FIXED | UNFIXED })
  - which join strategy to use (joinStrategy = { NESTEDLOOP | SORTMERGE | BROADCAST })

- Hints are provided in well-formatted "comments" starting with --SPLICE-PROPERTIES, and need to be placed 
at the end of SPECIFIC LINES of a multi-line query:
  - joinOrder after the word FROM
  - index and join strategy after the table listing
  
Here are some examples:

-- use idx1
select i
from a --SPLICE-PROPERTIES index=idx1
where i > 500;

-- use joinOrder and joinStrategy
select a.i, b.j
from  --SPLICE-PROPERTIES joinOrder=FIXED
a,b --SPLICE-PROPERTIES joinStrategy=SORTMERGE
where a.i = b.i;



=========================================
10. A list of known bugs and other issues
=========================================

- Certain features are not available as part of the 0.5 release but are expected to follow soon.  These include:
  - Users/roles/security
  - Cursors
  - Foreign key constraints
  - Triggers
  - Temporary tables

- If you create a long-running query that you want to kill, typing Control-C at the prompt won't kill the query.

- Certain DDL actions are not fully complete and/or do not maintain full transactional integrity.  It is best to execute DDL statements separate 
from DML statements for now.

- Complex nested joins (select * from d join (a left outer join (b join c on b1=c1) on a1 = a2) on d3 = b3)
  can fail.

- You currently cannot create an index on more than 16 columns.

- If you are running the database on a laptop, you will need to stop and restart the database after closing and reopening the laptop

- Restarting the database sometimes takes a couple of attempts.  The start and stop scripts will retry if needed.  If restarting
does not occur, check the splice.log.  If you see an exception but no "ready to accept connections", please retry the command.  
You are ready to go when you see the "ready to accept connections" message.
