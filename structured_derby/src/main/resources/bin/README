Welcome to the Splice Machine Private Beta Test Program.  This README file contains supplementary material
to the Getting Started Guide, found at http://doc.splicemachine.com

The Getting Started Guide currently presents instructions for setting up and testing the Splice Machine on
a single unclustered instance.  See the section below for instructions to deploy in a cluster.

Please visit http://support.splicemachine.com for any problems, questions, or comments, or to
report a bug.


=========================================================
Download URL - Single Unclustered Instance
=========================================================

To download the setup for the unclustered instance, use a web browser to navigate to the following (approx. 80 MB):
   http://d10sdxe2fhfs9c.cloudfront.net/splice_machine-0.5rc4-cloudera-cdh4.3.0_simple.tar.gz
   
   	If you use Linux without a web browser, you can use the "wget <file>" command to get the file:
	$ wget http://d10sdxe2fhfs9c.cloudfront.net/splice_machine-0.5rc4-cloudera-cdh4.3.0_simple.tar.gz
	

=====================================
Download URL - Sample Data
=====================================

Compressed, this is about 200MB of data.  The link to access this data is at:

=====================================
Deploying on a Cluster
=====================================

The instructions for deploying to the cluster are very different (and more involved) than the instructions to test 
on a single instance.  See the Getting Started Guide for single instance installation instructions.

At this time the only supported configuration during the Private Beta Test Program is a Cloudera Manager-managed 
cluster based on Cloudera's CDH 4.3.0 on Ubuntu Linux as its base starting point.

Step 1:  Install Cloudera Manager.  On a vanilla Ubuntu machine, Cloudera Manager can be installed as follows:

$ wget http://archive.cloudera.com/cm4/installer/latest/cloudera-manager-installer.bin
$ chmod +x cloudera-manager-installer.bin
$ sudo ./cloudera-manager-installer.bin

Answer prompts, etc., and let the installer finish.  You can test it by navigating to <host-address>:7180, 
logging in with username = admin, password = admin

Step 2: Create your cluster through the Cloudera Manager interface.  Note: You must use the Classic Wizard.  This will put you through 
the following steps:

a.  Specify hosts for cluster: select and validate the IP addresses of the cluster nodes

b.  Select the Repository.  Under "Use Parcels", click "More Options" and paste the following into the Custom Repository:

http://d1xswz7jccf7m5.cloudfront.net

IMPORTANT: Hit the "Add" button.  This will give an option for a new CDH parcel:

CDH-4.3.0-1.cdh4.3.0.splice0.5rc4.22

Choose None for Impala and Solr, and leave the default for Cloudera Manager Agent
(Matched release).  Click Continue.

c.  Provide security credentials as appropriate for your organization
d.  When prompted for the CDH4 services to install, select "Custom Services".  Afterward, select HDFS, Zookeeper, and HBase
e.  Database setup is for monitoring.  Click Test Connection, then Continue once the test is complete
f.  Review the Configuration Changes page.  Services will now start up.  

Step 3: Finalize installation of Splice Machine

While still in Cloudera Manager, we need to do some additional configurations in order for
Splice Machine's installation to be completed.

a.  Navigate to All Services (Services->All Services)
b.  To the right of your cluster's HBase configuration (it might be "hbase1"), select Actions->Stop.  Click Close
  once complete.
c.  Click on "Hbase" (or "hbase1") link on the Left.
d.  Navigate to Configuration->View and Edit->Service-Wide->Advanced and paste in the following into the 
"HBase Service Configuration Safety Valve for hbase-site.xml" (then click "Save Changes"):

</property>

e. Additional HBase Changes, Service-Wide:

  Maximum HBase Client Retries 40
  HBase Client Scanner Caching 1000

  (be sure to hit Save Changes before continuing)

f. Additional HBase Changes, RegionServer:
  (Note that you may have more than one "Region Server" heading on the left.  If so, 
   change them all)

   HBase RegionServer Handler Count 200
   Resource Management -> Heap Size 8GB.

   (be sure to hit Save Changes before continuing)

Step 4: Make the following HDFS setting changes:

 Namenode -> Resource Management -> Java Heap Size=2GB
 Namenode -> Performance -> NameNode Handler Count=60
 Namenode -> Performance -> NameNode Service Handler Count=60
 
 Datanode -> Resource Management -> Java Heap Size=2GB
 Datanode -> Performance -> Handler Count=20

Step 5: Make the following Zookeeper setting changes:

 Server -> Maximum Client Connections = 0 
 Server -> Maximum Session Timeout = 60000

 
Step 6: Stop and Restart Zookeeper and HDFS (but not HBase yet), and Delete existing /hbase directory:

From a command line:
$ sudo -su hdfs hadoop fs -rmr /hbase

Step 7: Create a new /hbase directory:

In Cloudera Manager, from the HBase window:  Actions->Create Root Directory

Step 8: Restart HBase

from HBase: Actions/Start

Step 9: Connect to the Splice Database

Start by using the splice.sh script provided:

$ ./splice.sh


=========================================
Cluster Operations
=========================================

You can use Cloudera Manager to perform most cluster operations once your Splice Machine 
is completely configured. 
 
There are however a couple of commands that will require shell script commands:

1.  Dropping and recreating the database

Should you wish to start over with a clean Splice database, do the following:

a. Stop HBase using Cloudera Manager
b. At a command line prompt on one of the servers, run the following:

$ ./dropdb.sh

c. Restart HBase


2.  Verifying that the Splice Database is up


 

=========================================
Connect with JDBC/ODBC Tools
=========================================

Business Intelligence and Query Visualization tools (such as Tableau and DbVisualizer) can
also be connected to the Splice Machine.  This is achieved through the use of our embedded JDBC driver 
or through the use of a third-party Apache Derby ODBC Driver.

a.  JDBC Connectivity Example

DbVisualizer (http://www.dbvis.com) is a simple example of a database visualization tool that connects
to Splice Machine via JDBC.  Once you have downloaded DbVisualizer (there is a free version):

1. Use Tools->Connection Wizard to start the process
2. Give the connection a name (e.g. Splice Machine Connection)
3. Under Select Database Driver, select "JavaDB/Derby Server"
4. Enter "app" for userid and password
5. For database server, leave as localhost if Splice Machine is running locally, otherwise enter the IP address
 of the machine that Splice is running on
6. For database enter splicedb
7. Do not check "Create Database"
8. Hit "Finish"

You will now see your connection listed in the left panel under Connections, and can explore the database
schema, enter queries, etc.

b.  ODBC Connectivity Example

Tableau (www.tableausoftware.com) 
  

=========================================
A list of known bugs and other issues
=========================================

- IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LAPTOP USERS: If you are running the database on a laptop, you will need to stop and 
restart the database after closing and reopening the laptop.

- The scripts used to start and stop the Splice database do NOT handle directories with spaces in them. 
Please be sure to create directories without spaces or other special characters.

- Certain features are not available as part of the 0.5 release but are expected to follow soon.  These include:
  - Users/roles/security
  - Cursors
  - Foreign key constraints
  - Triggers
  - Temporary tables
  - Materialized views

- If you create a long-running query that you want to kill, typing Control-C at the prompt won't kill the query.
If necessary you can stop and restart the database, or just start another query interface session in another
terminal window using ./bin/sqlshell.sh.

- Certain DDL actions are not fully complete and/or do not maintain full transactional integrity.  It is best to 
execute DDL statements separately from DML statements for now.

- Complex nested joins (select * from d join (a left outer join (b join c on b1=c1) on a1 = a2) on d3 = b3)
  can fail.

- You currently cannot create an index on more than 16 columns.

- Restarting the database sometimes takes a couple of attempts.  The start and stop scripts will retry if needed.  If restarting
does not occur, check the splice.log.  If you see an exception but no "ready to accept connections", please retry the command.  
You are ready to go when you see the "ready to accept connections" message.
