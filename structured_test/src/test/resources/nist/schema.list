# List of schema files to load - ORDER MATTERS
# This list should be maintained by adding any and all scripts that contain "create schema".
# Also, this list should be ordered so that all schema creation scripts that depend on
#   schema created by other schema creator scripts are ordered after them.
# VERY IMPORTANT -- any schema created in these scripts should be dropped in drop.sql!
