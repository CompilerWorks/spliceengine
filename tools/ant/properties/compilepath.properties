# jsr169compile.classpath
# Set for an individual code line to enable the build
# of JSR 169 (JDBC subset for J2ME/CDC/Foundation) classes.
# When this is set compile.classpath can be left as-is
# or set to the same value as jsr169compile.classpath
# to ensure that the classes in the base set are also
# suitable for J2ME/CDC/Foundation and thus do not rely on
# JDK 1.4 methods/classes not in J2ME.

# Java2 1.4 paths - for JDBC 3.0/JDK1.4
